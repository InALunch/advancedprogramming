# Lesson 4: Let's get some practice.

**To start this lesson, students should:**

**By completing this lesson, students will:**

* Gain a soldified understanding of variables, control flow, lists, and dictionaries.
* Get experience putting together more complex programs and desigining solutions to difficult coding problems.

Okay, in the last several lessons we introduced a decent amount of material. Getting familiar with Python and learning about things like lists and dictionaries can be scary and intimidating at first, but as you get further and further it starts to become routine. However, to get there, you need *practice*. In this lesson, we're going to focus on putting everything we've learned so far together through some coding.

> Remember, if there's something in Python that you want to do, but you either forgot how to or haven't done it before, **Google it!** In fact, there may be several problems in here that are very difficult to solve without Googling how to do certain things in Python. Remember, the best programmers aren't the people who know the most - it's the people that are the best at **figuring out what they don't know**. Learning how to be good at Googling is part of learning to be a good programmer.
