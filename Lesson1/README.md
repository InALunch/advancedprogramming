# Lesson 1: Some Housekeeping and Getting Started with Python  

**By the end of this lesson, students will**: 

* Have Python set up on your computer and be able to run Python files
* Be familiar with the terminal (and feel like a complete hacker when using it - trust me, you'll see)
* Be familiar with Python and how it's different from other coding languages they may have used


## Getting set up with Python

First things first! To start this class, we're going to need to set up Python on your computer. We will be using Python 2. This process will be different for Mac users and Windows users, so if you're using a Mac, go [here](macsetup.md), and if you're using a Windows computer, go [here](windowssetup.md), then and follow the intructions. When you're done, come back here and we'll continue.
