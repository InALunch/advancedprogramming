# Next Level Programming

Creator: Nathaniel Shak

Welcome to StreetCode's Next Level Programming Class! In this class we will go from knowing the basics of coding and having a couple of projects under our belt to learning some of the core concepts to really take your coding skills to the next level (hence, the name). This class will be taught using **Python**, specifically Python 2. The skills you learn in this class will be especially useful for anyone who wishes to pursue Computer Science more seriously in college or in any academic setting, people aiming to get into the tech industry one day as a software engineer, or people who just love coding and want to build some cool projects :)  

## Lessons

1. [Some Housekeeping and Getting Started with Python](Lesson1)
2. [Getting Familiar with Python](Lesson2)
3. [Lists and Dictionaries](Lesson3)
4. [Let's get some practice](Lesson4)

## Prerequisites for taking this classAs one of our more advanced course offerings, it’s important to make sure you’re ready before diving into the material. If this isn’t you yet, don’t worry! This doesn’t mean you’re not smart enough to take this class – it just means it would probably be best for you to take a step back and spend some time mastering these things before attempting this material.

### So, what should I know before starting this class?  

* **Have a good understanding of control flow.**  
This one is bolded since it's especially important. If you haven't heard the words, "**control flow**", before, that's fine! What people mean when they say this is understanding how things like **while loops**, **if and else statements**, and **for loops** work and how they fit together. You should be fairly familiar with all of these and should have used them many times in whatever languages you've coded in in the past.  

The rest of these are a bit more self explanatory, so I'll just list them out. You should know what all of these are and have used them in your code before:

* Variables
* Functions and parameters
* Booleans and Operations  (you should be familiar with statements like "num == 3" and "num = num + 2")

You should be able to look at code like this and tell what it will print out.

	a = 0
	while a < 20:
		a = a + 2
		if a == 12:
			print "I'm skipping this number because I don't like it."
		else:
			print a

Yes, it's fine if you haven't coded Python before (that's Python).

Again, if you don't feel like you qualify to take this class based off these criteria, **don't worry**. Learning how to code, like all things, takes patience and time. There’s nothing wrong with taking the time to go back and make sure you've mastered these things before taking this class.

## So, what will I learn from this class?

(Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with a lot of these or don't know what they mean. That's why we're learning them!)

### Topics

* Advanced control flow
* Object oriented programming
* Recursion
* Data structures
* Decomposition
* Algorithmic analysis (Big O)
* Underwater basket weaving
* Various algorithms
	* Sorting algorithms
	* Graph traversal algorithms


### Skills

Students should leave this class with:  

* A solid understanding of Python
* A working knowledge of Git
* The programming toolkit to build complex and comprehensive projects that require high-level algorithmic thinking.
* An understanding of good coding style and the concept of writing "good code" vs "code that works", how to effectively decompose and write readable code.
* The skillset to troubleshoot and debug their own code, how to independently research various kinks that come up while coding. AKA: "being good at Googling".
* The tools to succeed in technical interviews and beginner-level software internships.
* The ability to fly.

Anyways, let's get started!
